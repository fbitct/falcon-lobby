FalconLobby is an authorized AddOn for Falcon 4.0 Allied Force which was created
to support the multiplayer experience. FalconLobby retrieves the list of currently
active game servers and imports that list into the Falcon "phone book" (the list
of game servers shown on the MultiPlayer/Internet screen). This avoids the need
to "fat finger" in the IP addresses of the servers and provides a quick way to
see what online games are currently available. The list of active game servers is
populated from machines running game servers and FalconLobby.
